üö® MANUAL FIREBASE SETUP - STEP BY STEP üö®

PROBLEM: The user mahrukh.tibbi@gmail.com cannot login
CAUSE: Either Firebase Auth user OR Firestore document is missing/wrong

=== STEP 1: CHECK FIREBASE AUTH ===
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select project: "aesthetics-lab-1" 
3. Go to: Authentication ‚Üí Users
4. LOOK FOR: mahrukh.tibbi@gmail.com

IF USER EXISTS:
- Copy the UID (something like: abc123def456789xyz)
- Go to STEP 2

IF USER DOES NOT EXIST:
- Click "Add user"
- Email: mahrukh.tibbi@gmail.com
- Password: admin123456
- Click "Add user"
- Copy the UID that gets generated
- Go to STEP 2

=== STEP 2: CHECK/CREATE FIRESTORE DOCUMENT ===
1. Go to: Firestore Database ‚Üí Data tab
2. Look for collection: "users"
3. Look for document with UID from Step 1

IF DOCUMENT EXISTS:
- Check if it has all required fields
- Go to STEP 3

IF DOCUMENT DOES NOT EXIST:
- Click "Start collection" (if no users collection) OR click "Add document"
- Collection ID: users
- Document ID: [paste the UID from Step 1]
- Add these fields EXACTLY:

Field: userID
Type: string

Click SAVE

=== STEP 3: TEST LOGIN ===
1. Go to: http://localhost:8080
2. Email: mahrukh.tibbi@gmail.com
3. Password: admin123456
4. Click Login

IF STILL FAILS:
- Make sure UID in Firebase Auth matches Document ID in Firestore
- Make sure email is verified in Firebase Auth
- Make sure user is not disabled in Firebase Auth

=== CRITICAL: UID MUST MATCH! ===
The UID from Firebase Auth MUST be the exact same as the Document ID in Firestore!

Example:
Firebase Auth UID: abc123def456789xyz
Firestore Document ID: abc123def456789xyz
‚òùÔ∏è THESE MUST BE IDENTICAL!
