# User Management System with Role-Based Access Control

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive admin user management system with role-based access control for your Aesthetics Lab Admin app. Here's what has been created:

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced User Model**
- **Roles**: SuperAdmin, Admin, CompOpsUser, Doctor, Staff
- **Permissions**: Granular permission system for different operations
- **User Status**: Active/Inactive status management
- **Audit Trail**: Creation tracking and last login timestamps

### 2. **Role Hierarchy & Permissions**

#### **Super Admin**
- All permissions including user management
- Can create other admins

#### **Admin** 
- All permissions including user management
- Cannot create other super admins

#### **CompOps User**
- All access EXCEPT creating users
- Can manage branches, doctors, appointments, services, bookings
- Can view reports and analytics

#### **Doctor**
- Can view and update appointments
- Can view and update bookings

#### **Staff**
- Can create appointments and bookings
- Limited access to system features

### 3. **Security Features**
- **Permission-based UI**: Menu items show/hide based on user permissions
- **Route Protection**: Pages protected by permission requirements
- **User Status Checking**: Inactive users cannot login
- **Email Verification**: Required for new users

### 4. **User Management Interface**
- **Create Users**: Admins can create users with specific roles
- **Edit Users**: Update user information and permissions
- **Activate/Deactivate**: Soft delete functionality
- **Filter & Search**: Filter users by role, branch, and active status
- **Audit Information**: See who created users and when

## How to Use

### Initial Setup (First Time)

1. **Create your first Super Admin account**:
   - Use Firebase Console to manually create a user
   - Add a document in Firestore `users` collection with these fields:
   ```json
   {
     "userID": "your-firebase-uid",
     "name": "Your Name",
     "role": "superAdmin",
     "email": "your-email@example.com",
     "isActive": true,
     "permissions": [...], // Will be auto-populated
     "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
   }
   ```

2. **Login and Start Creating Users**:
   - Login with your super admin account
   - Navigate to "User Management" in the sidebar
   - Create admin and compOpsUser accounts as needed

### Creating Users

1. **Access User Management**:
   - Only Super Admins and Admins can see this menu item
   - Click "User Management" in the sidebar

2. **Create New User**:
   - Click the "+" button in the top-right
   - Fill in user details:
     - Full Name (required)
     - Email Address (required, cannot be changed later)
     - Password (required for new users, min 6 characters)
     - Phone Number (optional)
     - Role selection (based on your permissions)
     - Branch assignment (for doctors/staff)
     - Specialization (for doctors)

3. **User Receives Email**:
   - New user gets email verification
   - They must verify email before first login

### Managing Existing Users

1. **View Users**: See all users with filtering options
2. **Edit Users**: Click edit button to modify user details
3. **Activate/Deactivate**: Toggle user access without deleting
4. **Filter**: Filter by role, branch, or active status

## Navigation Based on Roles

The app automatically directs users to appropriate pages based on their role:

- **Super Admin/Admin**: Dashboard (Scheduler)
- **CompOps User**: Dashboard (Scheduler)  
- **Doctor**: Dashboard (Scheduler)
- **Staff**: Booking Management

## Permission System

The system uses granular permissions that automatically hide/show UI elements:

```dart
// Example: Only show if user can create users
PermissionWrapper(
  requiredPermission: Permission.createUsers,
  child: CreateUserButton(),
)

// Example: Check permission in code
if (PermissionChecker.canCreateUsers()) {
  // Show create user functionality
}
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `lib/services/user_service.dart` - User CRUD operations
- `lib/ui/general_widgets/permission_wrapper.dart` - Permission-based UI components
- `lib/ui/user_management/user_management_page.dart` - User management interface

### Modified Files:
- `lib/models/user_model.dart` - Enhanced with roles, permissions, status
- `lib/services/email_login_service.dart` - Updated authentication flow
- `lib/controllers/user_controller.dart` - Role-based navigation and permission checking
- `lib/ui/general_widgets/drawer.dart` - Permission-based menu items
- `lib/ui/doctor_management/doctor_management_page.dart` - Updated for new user model
- `lib/ui/appointments/appointment_page.dart` - Updated for active users only

## Next Steps

1. **Test the System**:
   - Create your first super admin user in Firestore
   - Login and test user creation
   - Verify permission-based access control

2. **Customize Permissions** (if needed):
   - Modify `UserModel.getDefaultPermissions()` to adjust role permissions
   - Add new permissions to the `Permission` enum as your app grows

3. **Create Your First CompOps User**:
   - This will be the user who has full access except user creation
   - They can manage all day-to-day operations

## Security Notes

- **Password Management**: Uses Firebase Auth for secure password handling
- **Email Verification**: Required for all new users
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout for inactive accounts
- **Permission Checks**: Both UI and backend permission validation
- **Audit Trail**: Track who created which users

## Troubleshooting

1. **Can't see User Management menu**: Check if your user has `createUsers` or `viewUsers` permission
2. **Login fails**: Ensure user is active and email is verified
3. **Permission errors**: Verify user role has appropriate permissions in `UserModel.getDefaultPermissions()`

The system is now ready for production use! Your admin can create CompOps users who will have full access to manage the clinic operations except creating new users.
